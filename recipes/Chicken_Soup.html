    <p>
      Sort of like pot roast, this is the long way of doing it. Making your own
      broth from scratch imparts deep flavors that are easily altered with the
      addition of extra herbs, or differing ammounts of ingredients. Add what
      you like, make it your own! You can also use the base of this recipe for a
      master stock, which can be used for a number of different recipes. Save
      them frozen to keep for longer.

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>3-4 lb. whole chicken</li>
      <li>4 tsp. kopsher salt</li>
      <li>2 medium onions</li>
      <li>4 medium carrots, divided</li>
      <li>4 celery stalks, divided</li>
      <li>2 heads of garlic</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. black peppercorns</li>
      <li>1/2 small bunch dill, divided</li>
      <li>6 oz. ditalini</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Season cavity and outside of chicken with 4 tsp salt</li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Cut <b>2 medium onions</b> into quarters (leave the skin on). Peel
        <b>4 medium carrots.</b> Coarsely chop 2; set remaining 2 aside.
        Coarsely chop <b>2 celery stalks</b>. Cut <b>2 heads of garlic</b> in
        half crosswise
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Combine chicken, cut vegetables, 1 Tbsp. black peppercorns, and 2 dill
        sprigs in a large pot. Cover with 14 cups cold water and bring to a
        simmer over medium-high heat. Cook, reducing heat as needed to maintain
        a simmer and using a large spoon to skim off any foam that rises to
        surface of pot, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest
        part of breast registers 155°, 20-25 minutes.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Using tongs, carefully lift whole chicken out of pot and transfer to a
        cutting board. Let rest until cool enough to handle.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Arrange chicken breast side up. Grab a wing and pull it outward so you
        can see where it attaches to the body. Using a sharp boning or chef’s
        knife, cut through the joint to separate wing from breast (if you hit
        bone, you're in the wrong spot; pull the wing out farther to help you
        get to the place where the joint meets the socket). Remove wing; repeat
        on the other side.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Cut through skin connecting 1 leg to carcass. Pull leg back until ball
        joint pops out of its socket; cut through the joint to separate the leg.
        Repeat on the other side.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Now for the breasts: Cut along left side of breastbone (which runs right
        down the center of the breast). Angling your knife, cut breast meat away
        from carcass. Repeat this process, cutting down along the right side of
        the breast bone for the remaining breast.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Pull off and discard any skin from legs and breasts (no need to discard
        skin of the wings). Return legs, wings, and what remains of the carcass
        to pot with vegetables. (You should now have only the chicken breasts
        remaining on your cutting board.)
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Continue to simmer soup, occasionally skimming fat that rises to the top
        with large spoon, until reduced by an inch or two and very
        full-flavored, about 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        While soup simmers, shred cooled chicken breasts with 2 forks into
        bite-sized pieces.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Thinly slice remaining 2 celery stalks crosswise. Cut remaining 2 medium
        carrots into ½" diagonal pieces. Finely chop enough dill to yield ¼ cup.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Transfer 2 chicken legs to cutting board to cool. Set a fine-mesh sieve
        over another large pot. Strain soup into second pot, discarding bones,
        carcass, wings, and vegetables.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Bring broth to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 6 oz. ditalini and stir
        once. Cook 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        While ditalini cooks, shred meat off 2 chicken legs; discard bones.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Add shredded chicken and sliced carrots and celery to pot and cook until
        pasta is cooked through and vegetables are tender but not mushy, 4–5
        minutes longer.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Remove pot from heat. Stir in dill. Season well with salt (it’s going to
        take a lot!) and pepper.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with more pepper.</li>
