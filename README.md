# odin-recipes

This here is the recipes project for The Odin Project fundamentals course. It will likely an amalgamation of the skills learned in this course so far. Using git, copying and managing repositories, using the terminal to navigate file directories, and of course using VS Code to create a "website" to upload recipes to. A lot of the work required to get this to work has already been done throughout my time taking notes, which are found within the git_test repository. Either way, this will be good practice.

Goals for this? Do majority of the work from memory, hopefully not having to use Google or something to solve the problems I'm sure I'll come across. A lot of what I'll be "concerned" with will be the boilerplate stuff, updating git, and remembering good practices for the actual writing in HTML. Prettier will help a lot with that, of course, but the goal is to not have it do much reformatting of the stuff I write.
